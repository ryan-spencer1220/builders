This assignment includes several files:

- readme.txt 		 this file

- instructions.txt	detailed assignment instructions

- background.txt 	 a (very) short story giving background and context
  			 for the assignment. This file is optional and you
  			 don't have to read it. It is just for fun.

- builders.cpp	 	the main driver for this program. You must use this 
  			for your main().

- extra_builders.cpp	an alternate main driver ONLY FOR EXTRA CREDIT. See
  			the instructions.txt file for more information on
  			extra credit. 

- structuretype.h/cpp	these files provide an enum structuretype to make it
  			easier to handle the different types.

- testlist.cpp    	these are example test programs for testing the stack
  teststack.cpp	        and linkedlist. You should use this as a starting point
			for developing your own test program. Unless you have
			named every file and data structure with the exact
			same names that I used, you will need to edit it to
			match your actual class names and files names.
