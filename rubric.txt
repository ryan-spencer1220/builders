This is the grading rubric for the Builders programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for huge.txt matches huge.txt.out 100% (including all
 whitespace)
 - the program runs on huge.txt in less than 1 second

Implementation	    10
 - The LinkedList class implements or deletes the copy constructor and
 assignment operator.
 - The LinkedList class doesn't do any output.
 - The Stack class coesn't do any output.
 - The Stack is implemented with a linked list (not an array)
 - The Builder class doesn't contain any stack or linked list implementation
 details.
 - The Request class has just one constructor and it takes the sector and
 structure type.
 - The "builders.cpp" is unchanged
 - Any other classes that have pointer data (if there are any) must follow the
 Rule of 3.
 - no memory leaks or errors

Design		     3
 - There is a class called Builder.
 - The Builder class contains a LinkedList data member for storing incoming
 requests.
 - The Builder class contains a Stack data member for storing processed
 requests.
 - The Stack class contains a LinkedList data member
 - There is a class called Request that holds the sector and structure type
 for a single request.

Style		     2
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
